Problem Statement: Skin Cancer Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that have been shown to be effective in skin cancer classification. 
CNNs can be trained on large datasets of skin cancer images to learn the features that distinguish between different types of skin cancer. 
This allows CNNs to predict the type of skin cancer in a new image with high accuracy.
